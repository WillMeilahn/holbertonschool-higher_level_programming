# Holberton School: Higher-level programming - Python

Module of **High-level programming** and **Python**, carried out during my **Software Engineering studies** at **[Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/)**.

## Technologies

* Shell Scripts are written in GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin20)
* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.8.9
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3
