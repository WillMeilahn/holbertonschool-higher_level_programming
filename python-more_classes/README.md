# Holberton School: More Classes and Objects

This poject aims to build upon object oriented programming (OOP), Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, instances and classes attributes in **Python** that we learnd in [`python-classes`](https://github.com/WillMeilahn/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/tree/main/python-classes).

## Technologies

* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.8.9
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.*)
